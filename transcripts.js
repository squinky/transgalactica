			{ time: 8.966, text: "Maybe you have known in the core of your being since you were three years old. Or maybe not." },
			{ time: 13.509, text: "Maybe you discovered the language that describes you best when you were in your twenties, and it was like coming home, or finally being able to stretch out an ache." },
			{ time: 21.263, text: "Maybe you have known for years, and maybe you came out to yourself yesterday." },
			{ time: 25.437, text: "Maybe you hated to look at yourself in the mirror, once you learned enough to know what society told you you were, and what you weren't." },
			{ time: 32.023, text: "Maybe you like your body just fine, and it's other people misgendering you that cuts to your core." },
			{ time: 37.132, text: "Maybe your narrative isn't neatly wrapped up with any bow, and doesn't fit any mold." },
			{ time: 41.691, text: "Maybe sometimes, you have to pretend that your gender identity is simpler than it is to get away from the questions, or for the comfort of those who don't understand you." },
			{ time: 49.908, text: "Maybe you have tried to convince yourself that your physical reality is irrelevant, that your gender is meaningless, that you are just a consciousness." },
			{ time: 57.642, text: "This probably isn't even the first time that you tune your long-range finders to this area, to this broadcast." },
			{ time: 63.041, text: "Maybe you've been waiting, and trying to decide if you are going to make the leap, try out our little adventure, and see where you end up." },
			{ time: 70.099, text: "No matter how you come to us, you are enough, you are enough, you are enough. You are trans enough, you are valid enough, you are simply...enough." },
			{ time: 78.865, text: "We know that there's no such thing as a Utopia, but hey, whatever we make together can't be worse than here, right?"},

			{ time: 5.137, text: "If you are a human being between the ages of zero months and however old the oldest living human being is (maybe like 107, probably?), this message concerns you." },
			{ time: 14.785, text: "We live under the kyriarchy, the systems of privilege and oppression that we all participate in." },
			{ time: 19.261, text: "If you feel that you are losing out when society is made more equitable, it is only because you had so much to begin with and others had so little." },
			{ time: 26.593, text: "Respect lived experiences. It is possible that someone else has experiences that you yourself have not had." },
			{ time: 32.160, text: "Social constructs still have power and influence over our behaviour even if they are constructs." },
			{ time: 36.949, text: "Ideological purity is a privilege. Navigating the kyriarchy is complicated." },
			{ time: 41.288, text: "Recognize genders beyond the binary. Many cultures have historically recognized non-binary genders." },
			{ time: 47.322, text: "Trans Women are Women. I repeat, Trans Women are Women." },
			{ time: 51.728, text: "Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists are not feminists. Intersectional feminism is the only feminism." },

			{ time: 0, text: "You’re listening to the Trans Radio Artists Network in Space." },
			{ time: 3.545, text: "Here is a brief history of singular they pronouns:" },
			{ time: 6.717, text: "Chaucer, a famous old dead white dude who wrote about farts and bodily humour a lot, and Shakespeare, an equally if not more famous dead white dude, who is credited with inventing words whenever he wanted, used singular they." },
			{ time: 17.500, text: "If you add their lifespans together, they lived and collectively used singular they for 108 years. But, other than that, the English language hasn't changed in any way whatsoever since Elizabethan times." },
			{ time: 26.904, text: "Now, English has no academy that determines correct usage, spelling or grammar rules, unlike some other languages (Here’s looking at you, France!), but nevertheless, in the mid-eighties, most style guides changed their recommendations about singular they to allow its use." },
			{ time: 39.460, text: "But, since your dad's elementary school teacher said that he should use 'he or she' instead of 'they' when he was a wee cabbage, and since your dad is considered an authority on the English language (right?), the entire world decided that singular they pronouns were shit and to nix them entirely." },
			{ time: 51.943, text: "So now we're stuck with the gender binary forever, because languages never evolve or change to suit the needs of their speakers. Damn." }

			{ time: 8.289, text: "Are you tired of having to do the emotional labour of reassuring them that they're not the worst person in the world just because you correct them about your pronouns?" },
			{ time: 16.643, text: "Have you hired a friend to follow you around and say your pronouns loudly when people misgender you?" },
			{ time: 21.995, text: "What if you could spray those pronoun problems away?" },
			{ time: 25.366, text: "Pronoun Pro-40 is an easy-to-use, no-mess solution for this ever-present problem that plagues so many of us." },
			{ time: 31.723, text: "Just apply the spray gently to your pronoun problem's face while firmly but softly saying the word 'no.' When they use the correct pronouns, give them a cookie!" },
			{ time: 40.324, text: "Based on years of testing, we guarantee results, or at the very least, a barrel of laughs. Best of all, you can get this product in an easy-to-assemble kit for our lowest price ever, nine ninety-five! Just add water!" },
